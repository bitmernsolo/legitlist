# 🛒 Vendor Guide

### Get listed as a trusted Bitaxe hardware seller.

Mining got centralized. Bitaxe is one piece of bringing it back to individuals. For that to work, the hardware needs to be genuine — and the people selling it need to be accountable.

This list isn't a barrier. It's a signal. A vendor on this list has been reviewed by the community and cleared by the core team. That means something to miners making a purchase decision.

## ✅ Who belongs here

You're a good fit if:

- You sell **genuine Bitaxe hardware** — not clones, not unverified boards sold as Bitaxe
- Your shop is **live and active** — real products, real stock, real orders going out the door
- You have **some presence in the community** — Discord, X, forums, anywhere people can find and vouch for you
- You have **no open reports** of fraud or counterfeits in the community

New to the community? That's fine — but expect the review to take longer while people get to know you.

## 📋 How to submit

### 1. Fork this repo

Go to the **[README](README.md)** and click **[Fork this repo](https://github.com/bitaxeorg/legitlist/fork)**.

Quick answers:
- **Do I need to rename the fork?** No — keep the default name.
- **Can I duplicate `vendors/_example.json` from GitHub UI?** Not directly. Create a new file and paste the template below.

### 2. Add your two files

**`vendors/{your-slug}.json`**

The slug is your unique identifier — use letters, numbers, hyphens or underscores. Example: `pivotal-mining` or `pivotal_mining`.

Copy `vendors/_example.json` and fill it in:

```json
{
  "name": "Your Shop Name",
  "slug": "your-shop-name",
  "website": "https://yourshop.com",
  "region": "North America",
  "country": "USA",
  "logo": "logos/your-shop-name.png",
  "description": "Tell miners who you are — what you sell, where you ship, how long you've been at it. Keep it under 280 characters.",
  "active": true,
  "social": {
    "x": "https://x.com/yourhandle",
    "instagram": "",
    "youtube": ""
  }
}
```

A few notes:
- **`description`** is optional but encouraged — it's what shows under your name on the site. Think of it as your one-tweet pitch to a miner deciding where to buy.
- **`active`** — leave it as `true`. The team manages this field; it only gets changed if a listing is suspended.
- **Social links** — include the full URL or leave the field as an empty string `""` to skip it.

Valid regions: `Europe` · `North America` · `South America` · `Asia Pacific` · `Middle East` · `Africa` · `India`

**`logos/{your-slug}.png`** (or .jpg / .webp)

Square, **400×400px recommended**. PNG, JPG, or WebP. Max **200 KB**.

Logo is required for new listings.

## 🔍 What happens next

1. **CI validates your files** — checks JSON schema, logo size, slug match. Fix anything it flags before the review starts.
2. **Community weighs in** — anyone in the Bitaxe/OSMU community can comment, ask questions, or vouch for you. This is the point. The review is public.
3. **Core team decides** — Skot, Wantclue, Derek or another core contributor merges or closes the PR, usually with a short explanation.

If your PR gets closed, fix the issues raised and re-apply.

## ❌ Getting removed

A listing can be removed if:
