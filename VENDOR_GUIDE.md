# 🛒 Vendor Guide

### Get listed as a trusted Bitaxe hardware seller.

Mining got centralized. Bitaxe is one piece of bringing it back to individuals. For that to work, the hardware needs to be genuine — and the people selling it need to be accountable.

This list isn't a barrier. It's a signal. A vendor on this list has been reviewed by the community and cleared by the core team. That means something to miners making a purchase decision.

## ✅ Who belongs here

You're a good fit if:

- You sell **genuine Bitaxe hardware** — not clones, not unverified boards sold as Bitaxe
- Your shop is **live and active** — real products, real stock, real orders going out the door
- You have **some presence in the community** — Discord, X, forums, anywhere people can find and vouch for you
- You have **no open reports** of fraud or counterfeits in the community

New to the community? That's fine — but expect the review to take longer while people get to know you.

## 📋 How to submit

You can do all of this directly in your browser on GitHub. No coding tools needed.

### 1. Create your copy of this repo

Open this page:

**https://github.com/bitaxeorg/legitlist/fork**

Then click **Create fork**.

Quick answer:
- **Do I need to rename the fork?** No — keep the default name.

### 2. Create your shop file

In your fork, open the `vendors` folder.

Then click:
**Add file** → **Create new file**

Name your file like this:

`your-shop-name.json`

  "slug": "your-shop-name",
  "website": "https://yourshop.com",
  "region": "Europe",
  "country": "Italy",
  "logo": "logos/your-shop-name.png",

  "active": true,
  "social": {
    "x": "https://x.com/yourhandle",
    "instagram": "",
    "youtube": ""
  }
}
```

A few notes:
- `description` is optional, but recommended
- leave `active` as `true`
- for social links, use the full URL or leave the field empty: `""`

Valid regions:
`Europe` · `North America` · `South America` · `Asia Pacific` · `Middle East` · `Africa` · `India`

Then click **Commit changes**.

### 3. Upload your logo

**Add file** → **Upload files**

Your logo must:
- use the same name as your shop file
- be square

Then click **Commit changes**.

## 🔍 What happens next

1. **CI validates your files** — checks JSON schema, logo size, slug match. Fix anything it flags before the review starts.
2. **Community weighs in** — anyone in the Bitaxe/OSMU community can comment, ask questions, or vouch for you. This is the point. The review is public.
3. **Core team decides** — Skot, Wantclue, Derek or another core contributor merges or closes the PR, usually with a short explanation.

If your PR gets closed, fix the issues raised and re-apply.

## 🔄 Keeping your listing current

Update your info — website, logo, description, socials — by opening a new PR with the changes. Same process, same review.

---

## ❌ Getting removed

A listing can be removed if:

- You're no longer selling genuine Bitaxe hardware
- Confirmed reports of fraud or counterfeits emerge
- Your shop goes dark for an extended period

Removals go through the same PR process — transparent, on the record, visible to everyone.
